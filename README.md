Detection of differentially regulated features becomes tricky for data with few replicates and high amounts of missing values. LimmaRP is a powerful R-based app designed to determine differentially regulated features in datasets with few replicates and the presence of missing values. This app excels in defining the differential regulation of genes, a critical step in understanding gene expression changes under various conditions. LimmaRP features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily upload and analyze their data of various types. With its robust capabilities, LimmaRP provides researchers with an efficient tool for gene expression analysis, even in challenging datasets. Reference: Veit Schw√§mmle et al.
